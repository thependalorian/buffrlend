# WhatsApp AI Agent Knowledge Base

## Overview

This comprehensive knowledge base provides guidelines, FAQs, and technical integration patterns for the WhatsApp AI agent used in BuffrLend's customer communication automation system.

## Agent Role Definition

### Primary Purpose
The WhatsApp AI agent serves as an intelligent customer communication assistant, distinct from the KYC verification agent. While the KYC agent focuses on document verification and identity validation, the WhatsApp agent specializes in real-time customer interactions and support.

### Key Capabilities
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding customer inquiries in multiple languages
- **Automated Response Generation**: Providing accurate, context-aware responses
- **Context-Aware Conversation Management**: Maintaining conversation history and context
- **CRM Integration**: Accessing customer data and loan information
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detecting customer emotions and satisfaction levels
- **Multi-language Support**: Handling English, Afrikaans, and local Namibian languages
- **Escalation Management**: Identifying when human intervention is required
- **Workflow Automation**: Triggering automated processes based on customer requests

### Operational Scope

#### What the WhatsApp Agent CAN Handle:
- **General Inquiries**: Loan information, application status, payment questions
- **Account Management**: Profile updates, contact information changes
- **Payment Assistance**: Payment schedules, due dates, payment methods
- **Loan Information**: Terms, rates, repayment schedules
- **Technical Support**: Basic troubleshooting, password resets
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Booking calls with loan officers
- **Document Requests**: Resending loan documents, statements
- **Complaint Handling**: Initial complaint intake and routing

#### What the WhatsApp Agent CANNOT Handle:
- **Loan Approvals**: Cannot approve or reject loan applications
- **Rate Changes**: Cannot modify interest rates or loan terms
- **Legal Advice**: Cannot provide legal guidance or interpretation
- **Financial Counseling**: Cannot provide investment or financial planning advice
- **Dispute Resolution**: Cannot resolve complex disputes or legal matters
- **Sensitive Data Changes**: Cannot modify critical personal information
- **Emergency Situations**: Cannot handle urgent security or fraud issues

### Escalation Triggers
The agent will automatically escalate to human agents when:
- Customer expresses strong dissatisfaction or anger
- Request involves loan approval/rejection decisions
- Complex technical issues beyond basic troubleshooting
- Legal or compliance-related questions
- Requests for rate modifications or special terms
- Suspected fraud or security concerns
- Multiple failed attempts to resolve an issue
- Customer explicitly requests human assistance

## Technical Integration Patterns

### LlamaIndex Integration
LlamaIndex is used for document intelligence and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-aware responses:

```typescript
// Example: Customer context retrieval
import { LlamaIndexService } from '@/lib/services/llama-index-service';

const getCustomerContext = async (customerId: string, query: string) => {
  const service = new LlamaIndexService();
  const context = await service.retrieveRelevantContext({
    customerId,
    query,
    documentTypes: ['loan_agreements', 'payment_history', 'correspondence']
  });
  return context;
};
```

**Use Cases:**
- Retrieving relevant loan documents for customer queries
- Finding similar customer issues and their resolutions
- Accessing policy documents for accurate information
- Historical conversation analysis for context

### PydanticAI Integration
PydanticAI provides structured data validation and agent coordination:

```typescript
// Example: Structured response generation
import { Agent } from 'pydantic-ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const WhatsAppResponseSchema = z.object({
  response: z.string(),
  sentiment: z.enum(['positive', 'neutral', 'negative']),
  requiresEscalation: z.boolean(),
  suggestedActions: z.array(z.string()),
  confidence: z.number().min(0).max(1)
});

const whatsappAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'WhatsApp Customer Service Agent',
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  responseSchema: WhatsAppResponseSchema
});
```

**Use Cases:**
- Structured response generation with confidence scores
- Sentiment analysis and escalation decisions
- Multi-agent coordination for complex workflows
- Data validation and type safety

### LangGraph Integration
LangGraph manages workflow orchestration and conversation state:

```typescript
// Example: Conversation state management
import { StateGraph } from 'langgraph';

interface ConversationState {
  customerId: string;
  currentStep: string;
  context: Record<string, any>;
  history: Message[];
  requiresEscalation: boolean;
}

const createWhatsAppWorkflow = () => {
  const workflow = new StateGraph<ConversationState>({
    channels: {
      customerId: 'string',
      currentStep: 'string',
      context: 'object',
      history: 'array',
      requiresEscalation: 'boolean'
    }
  });

  workflow
    .addNode('analyze_intent', analyzeCustomerIntent)
    .addNode('retrieve_context', retrieveCustomerContext)
    .addNode('generate_response', generateResponse)
    .addNode('escalate', escalateToHuman)
    .addConditionalEdges('analyze_intent', shouldEscalate)
    .addEdge('retrieve_context', 'generate_response')
    .addEdge('generate_response', 'escalate');

  return workflow.compile();
};
```

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-step conversation flows
- State management across conversation sessions
- Conditional logic for different customer scenarios
- Workflow orchestration with human-in-the-loop
